# Microfrontends practice

This repository is just some practice I did with microfrontends.

## Instructions on Running the Project

1. Make sure Node is installed. You can install it at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies for all packages.
4. Run `npm run start-all` to run all packages (concurrently).
5. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the project.
